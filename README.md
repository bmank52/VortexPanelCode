This project aims to use a vortex panel method to estimate the lift generated by a 2D airfoil, while showing the theory and application of undergraduate level aerodynamics. To use this code, fill out the user inputs at the top of code cell 1. Currently, this code supports NACA 4 digit airfoils and generates CL (2D) as well as the Cp distribution at an input AOA.
